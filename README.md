SQL project link - https://www.projectpro.io/article/sql-database-projects-for-data-analysis-to-practice/565


Data set gotten from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail

Questions I plan to answer from this dataset: 

- What is the distribution of order values across all customers in the dataset?
- How many unique products have each customer purchased?
- Which customers have only made a single purchase from the company?
- Which products are most commonly purchased together by customers in the dataset?
